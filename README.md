This is my project 3. 
It is a combined work of my original week3 assignment and my week4 assignment.
This is because my week 4 assignment was to make the original week3 assignment responsive. 
I was told to redesign a cetain design given to us.
Tools i used here are HTML & CSS. 
My main focus here was using  Box models (padding, margin, box size)
and Layouts (grid, flex box).
Also  Positioning (Absolute, relative, sticky, fixed), Flex Box fundamentals, Grid Layout fundamentals.
